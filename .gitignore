# Eclipse
# .classpath local machine's settings, not necessary (as per Rahim's assignment instructions)
.classpath

#i was playing around with another repo and when you update a project (alt+F5) without a .classpath file it creates a bin/ folder
#to keep that bin/ folder from being included in the repo i put it here in the .gitignore.
bin/

#.settings/ folder can be generated by "updating" project when it is cloned
.settings/

#target/ folder is generated when "update project" is pressed so don't need to include in repo
target/
